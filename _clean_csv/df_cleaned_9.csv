enjoy ten full chapters of drama and battle an unprecedented restoration of history every punctuation and pixel is carefully designed the details need to be tasted again and again of course there are still some drafts that need your continued support to update and improve when people ignore those who dare to fight for justice they are destroying the future when people ignore or fail to support those who struggle for justice they are actually weakening the moral foundations of society and the forces that drive the process of justice those who fight for justice are pioneers of social change and their actions can shed light on social injustice stimulate public awareness and drive improvements in laws and policies if these fighters are not supported society is bound to stagger and regress with more injustice and oppression such indifference sends a message that fighting for justice is futile a message that further weakens peoples willingness and courage to pursue change therefore supporting those who fight for justice is not only an individual recognition but also an investment in the future health of society as a whole to support this work is to support conscience those who brush up on bad reviews are all mouthpieces of those in power who have spent years by various means to stigmatize me and deceive and incite those who do not know the truth do not be fooled by them

world outlook comprehensively show the scene of the middle nineteenth century in 1831 william lloyd garrison raised the flag of emancipation and for three decades abolitionists fought valiantly in the east in 1854 the center of the struggle moved west to kansas and the great struggle would produce countless heroes by 1861 the second revolutionary war was in full swing kansas heroes and new people would fight side by side against the forces of slavery and the battle between freedom and slavery would begin as the first work to reveal the historical truth in all directions this work fully shows

brown jr jason brown owen brown frederick brown salmon brown david evans edward fitch james abbott john brown oliver brown compared to the heroic legend of america second revolutionary war other socalled civil war games feel like skits were not saying that other socalled civil war games arent fun and well admit that some of them are good but those games are more like skits and they certainly dont have the same depth and level as this one imagine that you are reading an epic book and are deeply attracted by the rich characters twists and turns of the plot and the grand historical background and the second revolutionary war is such a game it is an epic story and delicate plot as the skeleton with historical figures as the flesh and blood to bring the player completely into the era feel the heavy and great history in the second revolutionary war you penetrate into the heart of historical events not just as an observer but as a participant youll meet real people from history interact with them and maybe even change their fate you will experience the vicissitudes of history and feel the impact and impact of those major historical events the time span of the second revolutionary war is wider than that of other movies and games the other works without exception start in 1861 which is like telling the three kingdoms from 220 because they focus only on the battlefield and shooting this choice ignores the important historical events and figures that preceded it such as john brown and other great abolitionists who shaped the history of the second revolution and the second revolutionary war the second revolutionary war focuses on the real protagonists and heroes of this history whose stories begin not even with the kansas armed struggle of 1854 or the rise of the abolitionist movement in 1831 but with the seeds of the first revolution in the eighteenth century at the same time the story does not just focus on a single person or event but shows the whole history through a detailed plot showing the social political cultural and economic conditions of that era in great detail the other works even if they do refer to history before 1861 are once again a running list especially the practice of having fictional protagonists go through the motions of every important historical event which not only lacks historical authenticity but also makes the stories seem childish and ridiculous after all what is true is powerful finally the other works which invariably tend to ignore heroes like john brown belittling them if they cannot be ignored and even openly glorifying slaveholders are far behind their time in terms of moral and historical insight and even far behind the era of the people who witnessed the abolition of slavery the second revolutionary war pays more attention to revealing the truth of history and strives to present a more complete and true history overall the heroic legend of america second revolutionary war takes the player completely into the long river of history with an epic story and a delicate plot and performs better in depth and richness if you want to experience the magnificent history in the game the joys and sorrows of the characters emotional satisfaction and spiritual level of sublimation then this game is definitely your choice about english because im chinese my native language is chinese and of course this game was made in chinese for the english version that many netizens are eagerly looking forward to i dont have the money to hire a human translator so i can only use translation software to translate the chinese text into english for the time being for nonnative chinese speakers it is at least better than not understanding the plot and dialogue at all i will do my best to proofread the english names and places as much as possible the game has a lot of text so i will adjust my priorities and update the english version as much as possible taboo groups focus only on the picture cant appreciate long stories people who think this work is worthless neonazi haters slaveowner empathizer historical revisionist ultranationalist think this work is satirizing the x government someone who thinks hes similar to the villain in this game adverse reactions the main manifestations are the inexplicable hatred of the author difficult to restrain the impulse of rumormongering and slander the incoherent and crazy personal attacks and other behaviors if you have any of these symptoms seek medical attention as soon as possible ,you will travel back in time to

game grandpa grandpa whats that little boluofu looked at the sky and asked the grandpa one summer afternoon they were enjoying the cool at the gate of the factory a ufo directly dropped a virus missile without saying a word causing the factory and local people to be infected with z virus the sudden invasion made the united nations vibrate greatly in order to hide this matter the highlevel leaders came forward to confuse the people and put their hopes on the peace talks there is a difference of five civilized points in science and technology but they cant fight aliens soon learned all human languages requirements 1 contract all hospitals and prisons to aliens note conduct human experiments 2 cede most of the water source 3 it is forbidden to use navigation network gps and other communication equipment the people are very dissatisfied that the network is not used alone coupled with colonial rule mankind is ready to revolt although the equipment is simple and crude the chinese never flinch in the face of powerful enemies the x1 is the most powerful armor in the world it can still be used for repair hey captain master this is recruit cooper come and report well recruits today is very punctual we are going to chernobyl today our task is to get the virus samples from the research institute and wait for our helicopter it was to ensure the completion of the mission however our warship was attacked on the way only i came to chernobyl alive captain master asked me to wear x1 armor and complete the character he wanted to accomplish in his life before he died i nodded there are many infected people and aliens in chernobyl plus insufficient supplies fortunately the monster dropped all kinds of equipment and i was lucky to survive when the helicopter came to pick me up i breathed deeply and finally evacuated latest intelligence dr kane who studied virus samples was robbed by aliens and locked up in a local hospital in japan for the future of mankind it is time to save dr kane the hospital is not short of materials for the wave after wave of alien attacks i was beaten back by myself i received a notice there are important materials and armaments in the hospital take them with me and i also successfully completed the mission on my way to tokyo the helicopter was hit by an alien electromagnetic pulse and was shot down at the gate of a school named james i reported this to the organization they found that the pulse at night was relatively small and they could arrange evacuation they ordered me to do everything possible to survive until night so i had to stay in this abandoned school for a while time soon arrived in the evening i sealed all the windows and doors with sandbags but i couldnt stop some fish from escaping after cleaning i came to the attic i followed the helicopter of the double line army to tokyo the battle of tokyo is the most important battle which is related to the life and death of mankind the organization saw that i had x1 armor so it sent me to perform it alone i took the tokyo express and came to the street i had to do it the street was full of aliens and the green head matrix at this time i realized that the story had just begun the game is introduced on sunday in 2035 the aliens on ganymede invaded the earth and promised to give mankind a better future verbally but in fact this is an ornament of colonial rule they brought z112 a pathogen on ganymede this virus can infect humans it is the human brain controlled by the ufo central controller which automatically locks humans in a few miles around after infection it is divided into two kinds of people flawed people and the mother the flawed person has 100 blood but the movement speed is relatively slow the mother moves faster but the iq is not high and has independent thoughts in order to resist foreign enemies human beings have set up a double line secret service force that shocked the world the double line secret service force is wearing the worlds most advanced x1 protective clothing which can be immune to virus infection but it is still slightly inferior in the face of alien attacks x1 can enable human beings to obtain extremely fast

intelligence as well as the trigger finger multiple different types of enemies male and female protagonists original punk ambient and classical soundtrack a story based on sumarian legends the book of enoch and other ancient writings this story has no beginning and no end in the past a race of angels on a distant world had reached the limit of their development they had exhausted the natural resources of their planet and had faced stagnation and decline with their eventual decline before them they built the ship known as the sky citadel a mobile space city in which they could travel across the sea of stars to find new worlds which they could exploit and dominate enslaving any existing populations they might find after travelling the vastness of space and time they came upon the earth a planet rich in the minerals they needed for their technology they found vast deposits of gold deep within the subterranean caverns a valuable resource which they hoped would be a catalyst for a renaissance of their disintegrating culture upon the earth they discovered many lifeforms all of which were far more primitive than themselves lifeforms which they could using their science and magic change and modify to create slaves and playthings for their pleasure and use they took their angel essence and mixed it with the beasts of the grasslands to create docile and willing comfort males and females to satiate their lust they mixed their essence with the apes to create the slaves to mine minerals they desired they used their essence with the fishes of the oceans to create the builders of the great undersea city they created a myriad of giants dwarfs fabulous beautiful creatures monsters and abominations these creations were later to be known as the fae in time when the angels had taken vast amounts of gold from the earth they left to continue their odyssey of conquest and exploitation leaving 199 angels on earth to oversee the planet’s domination in time the angel overseers came to feel love for their subjects and began to breed with them and eventually school them in the arts of warfare science architecture medicine and aesthetics within time the overseers freed their slaves and adopted an egalitarian societal model eventually the former slaves and their former overseers built vast cities together creating a paradise upon the earth eventually the sky citadel returned after a long and unsuccessful voyage at this stage most of the technology of the sky citadel no longer functioned and all the knowledge of the home planet was now lost in the mists of time the angels had decided that they would now have to establish a new home upon the earth however the inhabitants of the returning sky citadel were horrified to find that the 199 overseers had created a new society and had genetically intermixed themselves with the slave races the action the angels took was swift and brutal led by the first clone of the master the angel champion the angels attacked the fabulous city of atlantis capturing most of the overseers crippling their wings torturing them and eventually imprisoning them in the caverns of subterrania they then moved the sky citadel closer to the earth causing fluctuations in the weather the result of which was a global flood that wiped out the civilisation of the overseers very few of the fae survived and those that did were forced to live hidden away and in secret the angels reestablished the old order using a newly created slave race part angel part ape to develop the science and technologies the angels needed to repair and develop the sky citadel which by this time was little more than a floating hulk with most of the technology no longer functioning the original science technology and knowledge which had been behind the building of the sky citadel were by this time long forgotten and lost to time the angels were now relying on their slaves to eventually develop an advanced civilisation which the angels would then take control of in the meantime deep in the caverns of the earth the former overseers and now rebel angels along with a few of the fae which had survived the flood had overthrown the guard race keeping them prisoner all of the guards had renounced their allegiance to the angels and had joined the rebels the rebel angels had then begun building a huge city so that they and their allies could live in comfort and safety as the rebels had been the scientists alchemists and thinkers of the original angel society they were able to utilise what resources they had at hand there were many new discoveries one of these being brimstone fire the sulphuric blue energy with which they could power and light their great city and another being vril the energy source which when combined with brimstone fire and focused through different mineral lenses could produce a super energy with the discovery of vril work began on the brimstone ray a canon so powerful it would be capable of neutralising all of the advanced technology on the sky citadel there was however a problem for the rebel angels the four gems which were to form the lenses needed for the vril accumulators the essential energy focusing component of the brimstone ray were located in the rebellion friendly city of sodom on the surface above city which was under attack by the angel army the angels had sent agents into sodom who had learned of the existence of the gems but not the location they had then used ‘rain of fire’ a primitive but effective technology where sulphur pellets were shot at a target from the sky citadel to destroy the city then as sodom burned and it’s citizens were reduced to panic and madness the angel soldiers moved in searching for the gems it is at this point our two heroes enter the story a rebel angel foot soldier and a dark angel resurrectionist they must find the gems before the angels do escape the falling city of sodom travel beneath the dead sea cross the bridge of the damned and enter the newly built third city of hell and take the gems to the vril multiplyers so that the brimstone ray can be fired,play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through

where did the universe come from it has always been a mystery and the concept of our culture has not escaped the notion of beginning and ending conceptually what was it at the beginning in recent years string theory has provided a highdimensional assumption but the problem has not yet been achieved where does the higher dimension come from i think it is difficult to explain but if the universe has no end and there is no beginning if the origin of the universe is out of nothing is it void who laid the rules so we created gods but who created gods damn this is endless so i stopped thinking logically and think philosophy about it yes it is it stops right here the players are the gods of the universe the main equation of this game is assuming that mass is space space is mass and mass itself is also energy and needs to be filled at all the time so the universe will shrink and extend continuously with time from another point of view it is cooling down i think that the universe will be in a state of static finally the average space density will be very low and it will approach to 0 there are no dark matters or dark energy in it perhaps this is the way of gravity the concept is like this players play as the god of the universe and control molecules of the universe through gravity string this is a simulation of theoretical physics the phenomena in game are controlled by fundamental interaction there are weak  electromagnetic  strong and gravitation interactions there are gravitational strings between players and influence each others universe through quantum entanglement there is a server at present but the stability of the network still needs to be tested players release energy mass space in game every time a big bang occurs or civilizations evolved players will gain some power from it these powers are used to generate gravity and the amount of powers players used will be affecting the amount of the gravity in this virtual 2d universe we can create countless big bangs players can play offline or online whatever you like in the future players will be free to create the server of the universe and allow to modify the parameters like coefficients of interactions or color mask of course players can modify them right now but it`s a little difficult for most players,universe sandbox simulation game,"['indie', 'simulation', 'strategy', 'early', 'access']",simulation 66 sandbox 40 2d platformer 35 idler 33 2d 30 surreal 24 procedural generation 22 strategy 21 indie 21 early access 21 asynchronous multiplayer 20,"['indie', 'simulation', 'strategy', 'early', 'access']"

in out path is a puzzlesolving game where you control a cat on a journey to find redemption however various birds will block your progress along the way as animals can only travel along certain paths you need to use mechanisms that can change the positional relationships between animals to construct a safe path the game consists of 7 chapters each with different themed landscapes and music it offers over 20 different mechanisms and more than 300 levels join our discord game features our games core gameplay revolves around position swapping the first chapter introduces the basic game mechanics moving paths and red birds moving paths are mechanisms that cause a path to move when an animal touches them red birds act as enemies for the cat  if the cat touches a red bird it fails through the use of switches and moving paths players can change the positional relationship between the cat and the birds to create a safe path for the cat to pass through in subsequent levels after the first chapter the game presents various variations of moving paths including rotation stretching and multisegment path swapping however each variation is not too difficult and serves more as a showcase and guide the difficulty gradually increases in the last few levels of the first chapter the puzzle elements are clearly displayed on the map and there is no need to search for hidden items the focus is more on testing the players logical reasoning in applying the existing mechanisms in the second chapter the game introduces multiple new mechanisms while continuing the design style of the first chapter each mechanism is introduced in a few small levels to teach its basic usage and the real challenge comes in the later levels this design allows players to smoothly experience most of the content in each chapter while still providing a certain level of challenge it feels like slicing vegetables before facing the ultimate boss most puzzle games are confined to a 2d plane but our game incorporates 3d stereoscopic as an important part of puzzle design from the beginning the third chapter introduces a jumping mechanism the cat can perform longrange jumps using a swing it can jump over birds on flat ground and onto higher ground on maps with elevated terrain the maps of the first two chapters can be considered as a 2d plane but starting from the third chapter the game officially enters a threedimensional world new puzzlesolving methods like aerial collisions and switching between different levels of terrain liberate players from the constraints of a 2d world and truly immerse them in a threedimensional game we believe that breaking free from the limitations of the 2d plane can lead to the creation of better games the fourth chapter introduces a special bird  the purple bird the cat can exert a force on the purple bird to move it closer or farther away this mechanic is similar to pushing boxes but it is different from the traditional boxpushing mechanic the operation of exerting force remotely requires players to have control over the position between the cat and the purple bird combined with the threedimensional multilevel maps players have to consider more factors compared to simple 2d boxpushing starting from the fifth chapter the game introduces many elements that require operational skills such as snowballs and timers that require calculating time the wind blowing mechanism in the sixth chapter and the duplication mechanism in the seventh chapter also require a certain level of player skill however we have added teleportation houses as a mechanism with classic position swapping functionality to add flavor although these levels require operational skills we have tried to provide players with a certain margin of error as we want operation to be just a seasoning with logical reasoning being the main course of the game after completing the regular levels players face the challenge of the expansion levels in each chapter although the expansion levels are unlocked after completing the regular levels of each chapter they are significantly more difficult if the regular levels are like playing dynasty warriors then the expansion levels are like playing dark souls clearly the regular levels only act as appetizers while the expansion levels reveal the true nature of the game this is why the regular levels may give a feeling of showcasing and guiding the player however the expansion levels do not introduce new mechanisms or require the use of existing mechanisms in new ways to complete the levels the content of the game consists of various combinations of existing mechanisms from the regular levels its like a teacher teaching you mathematical formulas and now expecting you to use these formulas to solve various problems the characteristics of the game can be summarized as follows 1 the game progresses from a 2d plane to a 3d plane with operational elements gradually demanding more cognitive and operational skills from the players creating a basic difficulty curve 2 the regular levels ensure a rhythm of unlocking new mechanisms at regular intervals providing a continuous sense of freshness 3 the final few levels of the regular levels are relatively difficult ensuring a certain degree of challenge 4 most of the challenging levels are reserved for the expansion levels allowing most players to smoothly experience the game while retaining depth furthermore getting stuck is a normal situation in puzzle games to assist players who get stuck we have implemented a hint system in the game the hint system provides a simple gameplay recording for players to reference players can see the key points of completing the current level in the video recording we hope that players can comfortably enjoy the game without feeling frustrated by being stuck on a particular level with our sincere love for puzzle games we have created in out path hoping to convey our passion to every player and let more people experience the joy of puzzle games  ,you will play the role of a smart and agile kitten learn and utilize various strange and interesting mechanisms to unlock 300 puzzles that are extremely characteristic and full of challenges to obtain an unforgettable puzzlesolving experience,"['adventure', 'casual', 'indie', 'strategy']",casual 81 puzzle 75 adventure 72 strategy 67 relaxing

updates  news  on the date 20112023 r1sikochess upgraded from version 73 to 74 resolving a bug related to the games audio  description r1sikochess is an idea that was born in 2021 and developed into a game over the course of two and a half years i was revisiting a video on youtube about the old commodore 64 game called archon an old 8bit masterpiece where two factions battled on a chessboard similar to chess but with pieces having the ability to challenge opposing pieces this sparked the initial concept for r1sikochess as a lover of chess  monopoly  risk  and strategic war games  i decided to blend all of these games and elements into a context of a final war two factions compete for a very specific cause the world dominion organization employs a new model to regulate the dynamics of the world and all its human beings from every nation around the globe every five years they organize a war that will serve to set new geopolitical parameters those who are called to participate in this war with the role of the first general of their army are actually taking part in a very unique race or even better a test the most important test of their life the climb to the pyramid the pyramid of the eye of providence by charles thomson the world dominion organization eagerly awaits the opportunity to judge you key features 1 the classic rules of the game of chess will be the starting point from here on it will be a new way of thinking about chess 2 28 monopoly style events divided into military political and economic categories 3 an artificial intelligence system that enables the cpu to analyze understand and learn your gameplay style be it political military economic etc and will use this knowledge to challenge you take advantage of your shortcomings and exploit your mistakes 4 every unit on the battlefield uses complex visual and mental calculations to perform their best during battles including retreat or extreme tactics 5 military units use 7 visual and auditory waves that operate dynamically depending on the scenario the vehicles involved the weather conditions and many other variables to understand the surrounding world and act accordingly 6 simulated weather with winds cloud cover intensity and the intensity of possible rain weak medium hard that will affect the characteristics of units on the battlefield especially aerial vehicles whether they are jets helicopters drones or airborne munitions 7 physics recreated to manage all vehicles equipment and ammunition debris from explosions will become like projectiles with their own mass and velocity causing real damage to vehicles and the environment a less precise attack does not necessarily mean it wont produce immense damage on the contrary one must pay close attention to the damage caused even by the shockwaves of explosions 8 the united nations will monitor the behavior of both factions and may impose sanctions more or less severe on nations that employ overly barbaric methods towards civilians or the enemy such sanctions can have various consequences in the military political or strategic domains and will have a specific duration based on the charges brought forth by the united nations it will be crucial to take these sanctions seriously being at odds with the united nations in r1sikochess as in the real world means being at odds with global public opinion 9 simulation of mines drones conventional aerial naval nuclear and biological weapons 10 accurate calculation of characteristics and damage to buildings natural objects the civilian population and all military units in the game 11 calculation of domestic and international public opinion that will judge your actions as the united nations do 12 each square on the chessboard will have its own geographical situation and special terrains that will really influence the players tactics you will be able to fight in open terrain in rural areas in small villages and all the way to cities each scenario will influence your tactics and the units you choose for battles if you want to avoid situations where your troops or vehicles are annihilated due to your poor strategic and tactical choices 13 dramatic simulation of rescue helicopters that will go through hell to save or health their men 14 simulation of terrorist attacks with calculations on the actual number of victims based on the geographic urban scenario and the type of terrain affected by such an attack 15 all the sounds during the fights are sounds of actual combat 16 end game full point calculations every axpects of the war will be analyzed in depth 17 full 42 pages instruction manual included in the game 18 many memes and references to the 80s and the era of the c64 find them all during the game and report them to the support email there will be a prize for the first person to discover them all and much much more,do you want to play chess monopoly risk or perhaps you want to

will have to use intelligence as well as the trigger finger multiple different types of enemies male and female protagonists original punk ambient and classical soundtrack a story based on sumarian legends the book of enoch and other ancient writings his story has no beginning and no end in the past a race of angels on a distant world had reached the limit of their development they had exhausted the natural resources of their planet and had faced stagnation and decline with their eventual decline before them they built the ship known as the sky citadel a mobile space city in which they could travel across the sea of stars to find new worlds which they could exploit and dominate enslaving any existing populations they might find after travelling the vastness of space and time they came upon the earth a planet rich in the minerals they needed for their technology they found vast deposits of gold deep within the subterranean caverns a valuable resource which they hoped would be a catalyst for a renaissance of their disintegrating culture upon the earth they discovered many lifeforms all of which were far more primitive than themselves lifeforms which they could using their science and magic change and modify to create slaves and playthings for their pleasure and use they took their angel essence and mixed it with the beasts of the grasslands to create docile and willing comfort males and females to satiate their lust they mixed their essence with the apes to create the slaves to mine minerals they desired they used their essence with the fishes of the oceans to create the builders of the great undersea city they created a myriad of giants dwarfs fabulous beautiful creatures monsters and abominations these creations were later to be known as the fae in time when the angels had taken vast amounts of gold from the earth they left to continue their odyssey of conquest and exploitation leaving 199 angels on earth to oversee the planet’s domination in time the angel overseers came to feel love for their subjects and began to breed with them and eventually school them in the arts of warfare science architecture medicine and aesthetics within time the overseers freed their slaves and adopted an egalitarian societal model eventually the former slaves and their former overseers built vast cities together creating a paradise upon the earth eventually the sky citadel returned after a long and unsuccessful voyage at this stage most of the technology of the sky citadel no longer functioned and all the knowledge of the home planet was now lost in the mists of time the angels had decided that they would now have to establish a new home upon the earth however the inhabitants of the returning sky citadel were horrified to find that the 199 overseers had created a new society and had genetically intermixed themselves with the slave races the action the angels took was swift and brutal led by the first clone of the master the angel champion the angels attacked the fabulous city of atlantis capturing most of the overseers crippling their wings torturing them and eventually imprisoning them in the caverns of subterrania they then moved the sky citadel closer to the earth causing fluctuations in the weather the result of which was a global flood that wiped out the civilisation of the overseers very few of the fae survived and those that did were forced to live hidden away and in secret the angels reestablished the old order using a newly created slave race part angel part ape to develop the science and technologies the angels needed to repair and develop the sky citadel which by this time was little more than a floating hulk with most of the technology no longer functioning the original science technology and knowledge which had been behind the building of the sky citadel were by this time long forgotten and lost to time the angels were now relying on their slaves to eventually develop an advanced civilisation which the angels would then take control of in the meantime deep in the caverns of the earth the former overseers and now rebel angels along with a few of the fae which had survived the flood had overthrown the guard race keeping them prisoner all of the guards had renounced their allegiance to the angels and had joined the rebels the rebel angels had then begun building a huge city so that they and their allies could live in comfort and safety as the rebels had been the scientists alchemists and thinkers of the original angel society they were able to utilise what resources they had at hand there were many new discoveries one of these being brimstone fire the sulphuric blue energy with which they could power and light their great city and another being vril the energy source which when combined with brimstone fire and focused through different mineral lenses could produce a super energy with the discovery of vril work began on the brimstone ray a canon so powerful it would be capable of neutralising all of the advanced technology on the sky citadel there was however a problem for the rebel angels the four gems which were to form the lenses needed for the vril accumulators the essential energy focusing component of the brimstone ray were located in the rebellion friendly city of sodom on the surface above city which was under attack by the angel army the angels had sent agents into sodom who had learned of the existence of the gems but not the location they had then used ‘rain of fire’ a primitive but effective technology where sulphur pellets were shot at a target from the sky citadel to destroy the city then as sodom burned and it’s citizens were reduced to panic and madness the angel soldiers moved in searching for the gems it is at this point a rebel angel foot soldier and a dark angel resurrectionist managed to defeat hundreds of angels and locate the gems before the angels did they then escaped the falling city of sodom travelled beneath the dead sea across the bridge of the damned and entered the newly built third city of hell where they took the gems to the vril accumulators then they made their way to the mountains at the top of the world and fired the brimstone ray the sky citadel was completely incapacitated by the blast leaving it a cratered rock floating in the earth’s sky following this victory the rebels began planning their final assault however the angel empire was far from finished in a secret location they had built a fabulous city where they had managed to relocate some of their advanced weaponry including a timetravelling device called ‘the bell’ ‘the bell’ had enabled the angels to make contact with developing civilizations in the earth’s future and exchange ideas weaponry and armour in addition to their hidden city the angels had also began creating a subterranean network of outposts and tunnels this network had enabled them to wage war on the rebel cities of hell in time with the aid of reconverted rebels the angels managed a major raid on the third city of hell stealing away all of the bloodfire and brimstone weapons they also managed to take with them the recently developed angelfire weapons the queen of the city is now in hiding awaiting assistance this raid gave the angels a distinct technological over the rebels who now face total extermination a team of elite dark angel soldiers have already attempted to locate and destroy ‘the bell’ in the hope of stopping the angels from gaining further technology from future civilizations the y managed to find the location of the hidden city which they have reported back is a a cemetery which archives the ashes of all the dead angels in the hope of resurrecting them sometime in the days yet to come the advance team also reported that although the angels have brimstone and bloodfire weapons they have yet to utilise them to their full potential also the angels now have in addition to archangels in their ranks several valkyries who are stronger and able to fly somewhat despite the earth’s strong gravity and the weight of their armour the advance team also managed to report that they had located ‘the bell’ and were about to attempt to destroy it however they were captured and now face torture and death in the angel’s prison the survival of the rebel angels now hangs in the balance the queen of the third city of hell needs to be saved and the angel occupation force defeated then the advance team needs to be rescued from the prison so that they can report the location of the angel city and the bell then the bell must be destroyed at all costs,play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through the necropolis of the angels the hidden angel city the underworld and the third city of hell an exciting thirdperson shooter where the

noise and color which can then be exported and used in your projects demo version theres a demo version of spritify that you can get for free to evaluate it in the demo some of the import and export functions are disabled also many of the sizes and factors are greatly limited palette canvas sprite counts scaling factors  all other features are available guide quick overview hotkeys note that several functions can also be performed via hotkeys hover your cursor over functions to see if theres a hotkey mapped to it canvas on the canvas you can draw your input image which is then used to generate your sprites the canvas displays both the color and behavior of individual pixels the color is displayed as a pixels color the behavior as a character more under brushes  you can left click to draw single pixels drag while holding the left mouse button to draw a path or right click to flood fill by default the canvas is filled with the background color and n one behavior when hovering with your cursor the currently active brush will be displayed the canvas after drawing several pixels the preview below the canvas theres a preview of the sprite it will display the same result youd receive by performing an export please note that the previews pixels are scaled to always use all available space your exported result will likely have smaller pixels sidebar the sidebar contains all of spritifys settings and controls the sidebar is split in groups which can be expanded and collapsed by clicking a groups header import  export here you can save and load projects and export your sprites load import a previously saved spritify project you can also import projects by opening the files with spritify or using dragampdrop save save your current project resultzip export your sprite as zip archive containing the individual bmp images resultbmp export your sprite as a single bmp image what you see in the preview brushes your current brush and pixels on the canvas consist of a color and behavior  the different brushes are described below color brushes the color brushes set the color a pixel will have the currently active brush is highlighted with gt youll notice that each name here has its distinct color these colors are also placed on the canvas when drawing with that brush background drawing pixels with the background color similar to erasing pixels you can set the background color in the colors controls fixed drawing pixels with the fixed color pixels using this color will always have the same color you can define which color to use in colors dynamic drawing pixels with the dynamic color pixels using this color will vary in color they might each end up with a different color noise and shading in your final sprite many settings affect how these pixels behave see more under flags  shading  noise and palette dynamic  background pixels will randomly either become a dynamic or background pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  background pixels will randomly either become a fixed or background pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  dynamic pixels will randomly either become a fixed or dynamic pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  dynamic  background pixels will randomly either become a fixed  dynamic or background pixel with a 333333 chance behavior brushes the behavior brushes define the behavior of a pixel during the generation process the currently active brush is highlighted with gt youll notice that the first character of each brush is highlighted thats the character that is being placed onto the canvas if you use this brush none this is basically the background or off of the behaviors pixels of this type are considered to not exist at all during the simulation static this is basically the on of the behaviors pixels of this type are always active and considered to be present during the simulation if pixels of this type are considered to be static if they have a neighbor otherwise they are considered to the none  with these pixels you can define areas that all turn on or off together walker these pixels will leave a trail on the canvas by following a random path theyll stop randomly or if they hit something they behave similar to the snake game filler pixels of this type will fill their surrounding area to a random degree they are similar to the walker pixels but instead of creating a trail they create more radial shapes like drops of ink jiggler jigglers will move randomly to a neighbor position or remain where they are any chooses any of the other behaviors randomly in this example you can see two groups of if pixels and a group of filler pixels in the result youll notice that the if groups are either present entirely or not at all whenever one of the filler pixels reached one of the groups the entire group got activated one of the if pixels activates due to having a neighbor which then can activate another if pixel until the entire group is active controls here you can find various functions to edit the canvas arrow left undo the last canvas action drawing resizing arrow right redo the last canvas action drawing resizing  zoom in displaying the canvas with larger pixels  zoom out displaying the

pixels flags in this group you can find multiple flags to control the sprite generation mirror right mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas to the right mirror down mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas downwards edge if the right or bottom edge should also be mirrored outline outline the final result with fixed pixels remove lonely remove pixels without any neighbours mirroring below some examples explaining the mirroring flags all mirroring is disabled and theres 4 pixels drawn to the bottom right of the canvas mirroring to the right is enabled the edge is not mirrored in addition to the 4 pixels we now see two of them being mirrored now both mirroring to the right and edge mirroring is enabled theres now 8 pixels visible since all 4 input pixels were mirrored additionally downwards mirroring is now enabled no edge outline when this is active the fixed color is used to outline the generated images this usually only makes sense when also setting the scaling to gt 1 since otherwise most pixels will be overwritten here the outline setting is disabled here the outline setting is enabled remove lonely removal of lonely pixels disabled theres pixels without any neighbours in the output removal of lonely pixels enabled theres no pixels without any neighbours in the output sprite counts here you can set the number of images your sprite will have count in x number of images per row count in y number of image rows shading in this group you can configure the shading enable shading here you can toggle the shading brightness sets the brightness of the shading specific direction enable this if you want to set a specific shading direction for all your sprite images otherwise a random direction is chosen per image direction sets the shading direction if specific direction is enabled below some example shading configurations here shading is disabled theres no brightness gradient within the images shading is enabled the brightness is set to high in this image shading is enabled the brightness set to low here the shading direction is set to down noise strength sets the strength of the noise how noisy the sprite will be a low noise value a high value is set for the noise scaling you can scale your output image creating several output pixels per input pixel be careful when combining this with high sprite counts since the sprite generation can then use a lot of memory and time also avoid setting high values for both scaling factors since their multiplication affects the performance both set to 10 gt 100x worse factor before this factor is applied before the simulation having an impact on it more pixels with different values this has a huge impact on the performance factor after this factor is applied at the end only affecting the size of the output pixels duplicated with their values this has less impact on the performance but still must be used with caution a scaling before factor of one every input pixel creates an output pixel a scaling before factor of two every input pixel creates 2x2 4 output pixels scaled with a factor before of 16 creating 16x16 256 output pixels per input pixel colors fixed the color of fixed pixels background the color of the background the default color configuration of black fixed pixels and a white background using different colors palette here you can choose an image that will be used as source for dynamic pixel colors if you dont choose an image random colors are used otherwise your images pixels are used as input reset unset the image and use random colors instead load load an image as color source an image of a fire being used as palette an image of the sky used as palette seed here you can define a seed used for the random generation changing this seed has a huge impact on the generated outcome edit text you can use the text field to set a specific seed roll click to use a randomly chosen seed result with a specific seed using another seed but the same configuration and
