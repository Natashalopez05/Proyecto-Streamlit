welcome to pyramid game maybe you are wondering why you need to play this game because pyramids are everywhere in the real world pyramidal architecture has been found all over the world in the long and bright history of human civilization when you enter the game you will be given a corresponding bank account that will immediately arrive with a sum of money which will be your initial funds the bank account will be determined by the level of bank you purchase with the game itself plus the 5 dlcs totaling 6 different levels of bank accounts and the initial amount of money arriving being the minimum daily closing balance for that level of bank account please note that purchasing the dlc does not add wealth to your existing assets the 6 bank levels generate 6 separate game archives because we are not looking for players to increase their wealth in the game by purchasing the dlc but rather these 6 initial funds symbolize 6 different classes of birth we want players to experience if the different classes of birth will affect where they end up some of our dlc is very expensive even though we know that players are fully capable of buying it but we do not want players to buy it but as a contrast our original intention is to let players understand that even if they are born with a low starting point they can still through their own hard work and wisdom finally arrive at a position that belongs to them maybe in the end this position is very high maybe not so high but both are the most suitable for them the most admirable similarly even if you were born with a high starting point its not easy to maintain your position all the time please remember that you will only have this initial amount of money and we will not add any microtransactions to increase your wealth as the original purpose of this game was to ensure absolute fairness for all players you can earn salary through different jobs the current job is some completely randomly generated math calculations and english words you can choose different number of questions or words and difficulty range to earn the corresponding salary regularly do these jobs believe that you will be able to get a great enhancement of your personal ability in reality when you have enough money you can go to the casino to grow your wealth why only the casino we have considered making a savings and investment system but no matter what we did we eventually realized that more money will always have an advantage over less money and its not completely fair our casino system is also limited to dice and roulette or other games controlled by a physics engine that we can think of in the future our casino system is absolutely fair to anyone of any wealth through multiple completely random factors and is controlled entirely through mechanics with no algorithms behind the scenes interfering with the results our purpose is to create the new world of pyramid game that is completely fair why is it called pyramid game because your personal asset value in the game will be ranked in real time with players all over the world in the pyramid game global leaderboard and your wealth changes will be uploaded every minute and you can see your global ranking changes synchronously after accumulating a certain number of players the system automatically weights the total wealth of all players and the percentage of players in each segment and divides all players into a to z levels according to their rankings and wealth theoretically pyramid game supports an unlimited number of players online all around the world at the same time and uploads data every minute and refreshes the global leaderboard every 10 seconds without any delay we are sure that there will be extremely computer talented players who will play this game and maybe you want to change the value of the total assets by modifying the game data but if you look carefully at the trailer and the screenshots you should have noticed that every transaction and even every result in our casino is recorded precisely to the second even though up to 500 to 1500 history records are displayed in the game but only for different computer configurations and smooth running of the game every record of this game from the first time it was run to the last is kept intact our wealth value is through these data for multidimensional calculation and verification wealth value does not exist in any of the values in the game and even each record has a set of hash value generated by a random hash algorithm we welcome players can crack the modified data to change the wealth to affect the ranking because it is a reflection of personal ability but we do not recommend doing so even though there is currently no program added that will clear the data if it detects that it has been modified it is very probable that the modification error causing the data is incomplete resulting in you have to restart the game by the way as a reminder you can check your bank balance while working or vacationing at the casino you can even check your bank transaction details while playing at the casino then work in your free time to make the most of every minute you have pyramid game inspires you to comprehend the real world in the game hope you find your position in the pyramid early,pyramid game inspires you to comprehend the real world in the

immediately on loading optional assisted analysis as you enter a game whenever you click on a piece an evaluation is produced for all its possible target squares tactical analysis will annotate game inserting commentary variations and diagrams before strong moves or errors into a game or an entire database it will also point out combinations played in the game or missed tries attacks initiative and of course the latest in openings theory cloud analysis you can analyse positions simultaneously with several engines from on dierent computers running in parallel deep analysis generates an analysis tree that changes dynamically as with time weaker variations are dropped automatic analysis jobs for correspondence games replay training playing through a game with the notation hidden and

with recognition of their weaknesses generate a comprehensive openings report with main and critical lines plans and most important games urgent news about recently played innovations search for characteristic tactical positions in an opening variation single click publication of games on the internet improved search mask with tactical motifs and examples for manoeuvres and material distribution completely new search booster for patterns and plans print games in superb quality with diagrams and multiple columns crisp new 3d boards thanks to raytracing technology access to the chessbase online database with over eight million games the most important innovations chessbase 17 focusses at things that in our view are the foremost of the programs areas of application first of all a lot of work has gone into functions that one only notices subconsciously but which improve the user experience the new ultrahighresolution 2d board the really crisp display of notation and lists through support of direct 2d which runs on all recent windows versions and popular in more recent times the dark mode technical improvements then there are many technical improvements that generally improve the program such as a new faster data format with fewer files and no search booster  which overcomes limitations of the cbh format and a finetuning of the database paths that solves conflicts with the documents directory and onedrive so you can smoothly manage your databases outside the standard windows directories interactive search mask and much more the smart inputting of positions is of direct chess significance you place a few pieces onto the board and immediately see in which games of the reference database this position fragment occurs by clicking on a game you can save yourself the rest of the inputting the new search mask is also more interactive if you enter a search criterion the number of games in the database for which it matches is immediately displayed this way you know what yield to expect before you click on ok the new engine window a lot has also been done in an area that is crucial for daily chess work the engine window most chessbase users probably spend 90 of their time with interactive analysis of positions the output of engines has altered little in the last 30 years variations evaluations dry as dust done in chessbase 17 this has been fundamentally reevaluated the visual evaluation of pieces and measurement of complexity  you know from fritz 18 the display of nontrivial threats or temptations is fancy but also already familiar the same goes for the training option to suppress the entire engine output and only receive subtle tips as a stimulus to your own thinking this is primarily intended for when watching live games analysis in natural language however the interpretation of an engine variation in natural language is groundbreakingly new it is often a challenge for many players to imagine what is actually happening based on just an engine variation you see the best move the rating and thats it chessbase 17 describes in words what the variation entails for example in a supersharp position a complex variation has the strange rating 000 chessbase 17 would then add perpetual check or repetition of the position and the situation would become clear material changes are vividly described white wins the queen for rook and knight black loses two pawns and even the position is simplified into an endgame rb vs rn there are also exciting statements like white gains a dangerous passed pawn on e6 or white sacrifices a bishop black has an attack white gets the majority on the kingside both kings are insecure and manoeuvre nd2f1e3d5 etc such assertions clarify the motives behind a position if you want to understand even more of what the program means by these hints simply move the mouse over the move indicated and the position appears on the main board clicking on a move copies the variation up to that move into the notation which then simplifies the commentary the more colourful the sharper  or death to the exclamation mark it does make a dierence whether a position contains sharply forced variations or several moves of almost equal value todays engines do not provide this information chessbase 17 therefore diverts a small part of the hardware resources towards a clone of the main engine and calls this the buddy engine  this only slightly impacts the computing power of the main engine buddy now goes over the variations and analyses the position after each move the variations are saved so that you can easily view them by moving your mouse cursor over on the move importantly forced moves are annotated with coloured rectangles the exclamation mark used in commenting on games for 170 years doesn’t do justice to buddys search results therefore we now only use it for sacrifices the colour of the rectangles indicates the evaluation the shape shows from which depth the forcing is recognised in the calculation trivial tactics have vertically divided rectangles medium forcing divides the rectangle into two triangles from top left to bottom right deep forcing divides diagonally from right to left if the upper or left part is green the move wins if the lower part is yellow for example the position remains roughly in the draw range after the worse alternative move if it is red the alternative move loses this system may seem complex at first glance but it has the advantage that a lot of information is signalled in one spacesaving symbol the exclamation mark has had its day in any case one thing is clear the more colourful the more forcing for years we have recommended analysing with two engine variations so that at least one forced main move can be recognised immediately however this costs a lot of additional computing time chessbase 17 marks the beginning of a renaissance of singlevariation analysis at the same time the calculation goes much deeper buddy shows whether the first move is forced and also provides the second variation new in chessbase 17  new data format fewer files more functions more comfort more speed  engine analysis renovated variants are automatically verbally annotated forced continuations are recognized buddy heuristics for greater search depth  pearl search find spectacular games instantly beautiful games are marked in the database list  optimised program interface highresolution 2d board faster graphics  new clearer search mask material amp positional searches simplified immediate feedback on expected results  intelligent position input when setting up pieces you are shown the games where those positions occur  dozens of detail improvements for improved usability eg automatic loading of the last edited game  control

enjoy ten full chapters of drama and battle an unprecedented restoration of history every punctuation and pixel is carefully designed the details need to be tasted again and again of course there are still some drafts that need your continued support to update and improve when people ignore those who dare to fight for justice they are destroying the future when people ignore or fail to support those who struggle for justice they are actually weakening the moral foundations of society and the forces that drive the process of justice those who fight for justice are pioneers of social change and their actions can shed light on social injustice stimulate public awareness and drive improvements in laws and policies if these fighters are not supported society is bound to stagger and regress with more injustice and oppression such indifference sends a message that fighting for justice is futile a message that further weakens peoples willingness and courage to pursue change therefore supporting those who fight for justice is not only an individual recognition but also an investment in the future health of society as a whole to support this work is to support conscience those who brush up on bad reviews are all mouthpieces of those in power who have spent years by various means to stigmatize me and deceive and incite those who do not know the truth do not be fooled by them

colonies rose up and won the revolutionary war but slavery forces claws extending across the continent when darkness once again enveloped the land new heroes rose up to fight for hope epic story huge world outlook comprehensively show the scene of the middle nineteenth century in 1831 william lloyd garrison raised the flag of emancipation and for three decades abolitionists fought valiantly in the east in 1854 the center of the struggle moved west to kansas and the great struggle would produce countless heroes by 1861 the second revolutionary war was in full swing kansas heroes and new people would fight side by side against the forces of slavery and the battle between freedom and slavery would begin as the first work to reveal the historical truth in all directions this work fully shows the appearance of life in different places the opinions of various forces the views of different figures and many unknown details srpg lots of characters and historical battles over a 3000 historical

brown jr jason brown owen brown frederick brown salmon brown david evans edward fitch james abbott john brown oliver brown compared to the heroic legend of america second revolutionary war other socalled civil war games feel like skits were not saying that other socalled civil war games arent fun and well admit that some of them are good but those games are more like skits and they certainly dont have the same depth and level as this one imagine that you are reading an epic book and are deeply attracted by the rich characters twists and turns of the plot and the grand historical background and the second revolutionary war is such a game it is an epic story and delicate plot as the skeleton with historical figures as the flesh and blood to bring the player completely into the era feel the heavy and great history in the second revolutionary war you penetrate into the heart of historical events not just as an observer but as a participant youll meet real people from history interact with them and maybe even change their fate you will experience the vicissitudes of history and feel the impact and impact of those major historical events the time span of the second revolutionary war is wider than that of other movies and games the other works without exception start in 1861 which is like telling the three kingdoms from 220 because they focus only on the battlefield and shooting this choice ignores the important historical events and figures that preceded it such as john brown and other great abolitionists who shaped the history of the second revolution and the second revolutionary war the second revolutionary war focuses on the real protagonists and heroes of this history whose stories begin not even with the kansas armed struggle of 1854 or the rise of the abolitionist movement in 1831 but with the seeds of the first revolution in the eighteenth century at the same time the story does not just focus on a single person or event but shows the whole history through a detailed plot showing the social political cultural and economic conditions of that era in great detail the other works even if they do refer to history before 1861 are once again a running list especially the practice of having fictional protagonists go through the motions of every important historical event which not only lacks historical authenticity but also makes the stories seem childish and ridiculous after all what is true is powerful finally the other works which invariably tend to ignore heroes like john brown belittling them if they cannot be ignored and even openly glorifying slaveholders are far behind their time in terms of moral and historical insight and even far behind the era of the people who witnessed the abolition of slavery the second revolutionary war pays more attention to revealing the truth of history and strives to present a more complete and true history overall the heroic legend of america second revolutionary war takes the player completely into the long river of history with an epic story and a delicate plot and performs better in depth and richness if you want to experience the magnificent history in the game the joys and sorrows of the characters emotional satisfaction and spiritual level of sublimation then this game is definitely your choice about english because im chinese my native language is

game grandpa grandpa whats that little boluofu looked at the sky and asked the grandpa one summer afternoon they were enjoying the cool at the gate of the factory a ufo directly dropped a virus missile without saying a word causing the factory and local people to be infected with z virus the sudden invasion made the united nations vibrate greatly in order to hide this matter the highlevel leaders came forward to confuse the people and put their hopes on the peace talks there is a difference of five civilized points in science and technology but they cant fight aliens soon learned all human languages requirements 1 contract all hospitals and prisons to aliens note conduct human experiments 2 cede most of the water source 3 it is forbidden to use navigation network gps and other communication equipment the people are very dissatisfied that the network is not used alone coupled with colonial rule mankind is ready to revolt although the equipment is simple and crude the chinese never flinch in the face of powerful enemies the x1 is the most powerful armor in the world it can still be used for repair hey captain master this is recruit cooper come and report well recruits today is very punctual we are going to chernobyl today our task is to get the virus samples from the research institute and wait for our helicopter it was to ensure the completion of the mission however our warship was attacked on the way only i came to chernobyl alive captain master asked me to wear x1 armor and complete the character he wanted to accomplish in his life before he died i nodded there are many infected people and aliens in chernobyl plus insufficient supplies fortunately the monster dropped all kinds of equipment and i was lucky to survive when the helicopter came to pick me up i breathed deeply and finally evacuated latest intelligence dr kane who studied virus samples was robbed by aliens and locked up in a local hospital in japan for the future of mankind it is time to save dr kane the hospital is not short of materials for the wave after wave of alien attacks i was beaten back by myself i received a notice there are important materials and armaments in the hospital take them with me and i also successfully completed the mission on my way to tokyo the helicopter was hit by an alien electromagnetic pulse and was shot down at the gate of a school named james i reported this to the organization they found that the pulse at night was relatively small and they could arrange evacuation they ordered me to do everything possible to survive until night so i had to stay in this abandoned school for a while time soon arrived in the evening i sealed all the windows and doors with sandbags but i couldnt stop some fish from escaping after cleaning i came to the attic i followed the helicopter of the double line army to tokyo the battle of tokyo is the most important battle which is related to the life and death of mankind the organization saw that i had x1 armor so it sent me to perform it alone i took the tokyo express and came to the street i had to do it the street was full of aliens and the green head matrix at this time i realized that the story had just begun the game is introduced on sunday in 2035 the aliens on ganymede invaded the earth and promised to give mankind a better future verbally but in fact this is an ornament of colonial rule they brought z112 a pathogen on ganymede this virus can infect humans it is the human brain controlled by the ufo central controller which automatically locks humans in a few miles around after infection it is divided into two kinds of people flawed people and the mother the flawed person has 100 blood but the movement speed is relatively slow the mother moves faster but the iq is not high and has independent thoughts in order to resist foreign enemies human beings have set up a double line secret service force that shocked the world the double line secret service force is wearing the worlds most advanced x1 protective clothing which can be immune to virus infection but it is still slightly inferior in the face of alien attacks x1 can enable human beings to obtain extremely fast

play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through the burning streets of sodom the underworld and third city of hell an exciting thirdperson shooter where the player will have to use intelligence as well as the trigger finger multiple different types of enemies male and female protagonists original punk ambient and classical soundtrack a story based on sumarian legends the book of enoch and other ancient writings this story has no beginning and no end in the past a race of angels on a distant world had reached the limit of their development they had exhausted the natural resources of their planet and had faced stagnation and decline with their eventual decline before them they built the ship known as the sky citadel a mobile space city in which they could travel across the sea of stars to find new worlds which they could exploit and dominate enslaving any existing populations they might find after travelling the vastness of space and time they came upon the earth a planet rich in the minerals they needed for their technology they found vast deposits of gold deep within the subterranean caverns a valuable resource which they hoped would be a catalyst for a renaissance of their disintegrating culture upon the earth they discovered many lifeforms all of which were far more primitive than themselves lifeforms which they could using their science and magic change and modify to create slaves and playthings for their pleasure and use they took their angel essence and mixed it with the beasts of the grasslands to create docile and willing comfort males and females to satiate their lust they mixed their essence with the apes to create the slaves to mine minerals they desired they used their essence with the fishes of the oceans to create the builders of the great undersea city they created a myriad of giants dwarfs fabulous beautiful creatures monsters and abominations these creations were later to be known as the fae in time when the angels had taken vast amounts of gold from the earth they left to continue their odyssey of conquest and exploitation leaving 199 angels on earth to oversee the planet’s domination in time the angel overseers came to feel love for their subjects and began to breed with them and eventually school them in the arts of warfare science architecture medicine and aesthetics within time the overseers freed their slaves and adopted an egalitarian societal model eventually the former slaves and their former overseers built vast cities together creating a paradise upon the earth eventually the sky citadel returned after a long and unsuccessful voyage at this stage most of the technology of the sky citadel no longer functioned and all the knowledge of the home planet was now lost in the mists of time the angels had decided that they would now have to establish a new home upon the earth however the inhabitants of the returning sky citadel were horrified to find that the 199 overseers had created a new society and had genetically intermixed themselves with the slave races the action the angels took was swift and brutal led by the first clone of the master the angel champion the angels attacked the fabulous city of atlantis capturing most of the overseers crippling their wings torturing them and eventually imprisoning them in the caverns of subterrania they then moved the sky citadel closer to the earth causing fluctuations in the weather the result of which was a global flood that wiped out the civilisation of the overseers very few of the fae survived and those that did were forced to live hidden away and in secret the angels reestablished the old order using a newly created slave race part angel part ape to develop the science and technologies the angels needed to repair and develop the sky citadel which by this time was little more than a floating hulk with most of the technology no longer functioning the original science technology and knowledge which had been behind the building of the sky citadel were by this time long forgotten and lost to time the angels were now relying on their slaves to eventually develop an advanced civilisation which the angels would then take control of in the meantime deep in the caverns of the earth the former overseers and now rebel angels along with a few of the fae which had survived the flood had overthrown the guard race keeping them prisoner all of the guards had renounced their allegiance to the angels and had joined the rebels the rebel angels had then begun building a huge city so that they and their allies could live in comfort and safety as the rebels had been the scientists alchemists and thinkers of the original angel society they were able to utilise what resources they had at hand there were many new discoveries one of these being brimstone fire the sulphuric blue energy with which they could power and light their great city and another being vril the energy source which when combined with brimstone fire and focused through different mineral lenses could produce a super energy with the discovery of vril work began on the brimstone ray a canon so powerful it would be capable of neutralising all of the advanced technology on the sky citadel there was however a problem for the rebel angels the four gems which were to form the lenses needed for the vril accumulators the essential energy focusing component of the brimstone ray were located in the rebellion friendly city of sodom on the surface above city which was under attack by the angel army the angels had sent agents into sodom who had learned of the existence of the gems but not the location they had then used ‘rain of fire’ a primitive but effective technology where sulphur pellets were shot at a target from the sky citadel to destroy the city then as sodom burned and it’s citizens were reduced to panic and madness the angel soldiers moved in searching for the gems it is at this point our two heroes enter the story a rebel angel foot soldier and a dark angel resurrectionist they must find the gems before the angels do escape the falling city of sodom travel beneath the dead sea cross the bridge of the damned and enter the newly built third city of hell and take the gems to the vril multiplyers so that the brimstone ray can be fired,play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through

in 1525 durer invented his drawing machine it is a way to mechanically produce a picture drawing machine is an implementation of this technique on a desktop that helps you draw a picture this app will help you learn to draw as your skill improves you can use the app less and less as you develop the proper mental repertoire for drawing pictures this app is divide and conquer as it can be applied to drawing durers drawing machine works by dividing the picture into many smaller contiguouslyconnected pictures instead of drawing one large picture all at once you draw each of many small pictures one after another you can see how each smaller picture is connected to the other small pictures the original picture is cut up into these smaller pieces by you specifying the number of squares you want if you specify 10 squares then the original picture is sectioned into a 10 by 10 mesh of smaller pictures for a total of 100 small connected pictures overall the technique is very simple and very effective this app is useful whenever someone who is not an artist needs to draw a picture if you need to draw a picture to be used on computer then you can use this app to draw whatever picture you need this is true even if you are a bad artist you can take a picture with your cell phone and use that image in the drawing machine to create your very own personalized version of your photo you can look up any picture online and use the drawing machine to create the picture you would draw if you really were a good artist therefore this app can be used for design and illustration for web page design for animation and modeling or for any process which requires pictures or images you can use the app to become a better artist or to add your personal artistic graphic touch to your game many of us are not good artists but must produce pictures or images for our aspiring games we cant afford to hire professional artists to create our pictures you can plug this app into the gap in your skills that exists if you arent an artist if you wish you can use the app only to locate and place certain problematic points on your target image alternatively you use the app only for some of the picture but not all of the picture this app extends durers drawing machine by providing two additional helpful features the crosshairs feature allows you to create within the grid pinpoint accurate crosshairs on points of interest you can use the crosshairs to reduce the number of squares you have to deal with thus making it easier to use the technique these crosshairs allow you to be exactly correct when you place critical points the perspectives feature helps you plot various types of perspectives onto your targeted image ie 1 point 2 point or 3 point perspectives with their various vanishing points these two features improve the basic functionality of durers drawing machine an update released on 952022 removes the worst thing about using drawing machine before the update you had to manually draw your grids on your drawing surface in the update a way to automatically generate a set of blank grids was added once you have your blank grids you could pick the one you like best and print as many copies as you like you could have managed to create your own printable blank grids yourself but this way drawing machine will do it for you this removes a tedious boring and timeconsuming step in the process note you could print your starting image which has no grids your starting image with a grid overlaid on it and several copies on printer paper of blank grids properly dimensioned to match your start image in this usage case you could take all these printed sheets with you on your vacation and never have to use a cellphone or computer during your vacation while you practice drawing if you have kids then this would be a great cheap way to give them something to do on vacation another improvement in the update was to allow you to merge several other images over portions of your starting image this gives a capability like you see in gimp or some photo shopping program but it all occurs in an intuitive fashion within drawing machine still another improvement is to allow you to select

where did the universe come from it has always been a mystery and the concept of our culture has not escaped the notion of beginning and ending conceptually what was it at the beginning in recent years string theory has provided a highdimensional assumption but the problem has not yet been achieved where does the higher dimension come from i think it is difficult to explain but if the universe has no end and there is no beginning if the origin of the universe is out of nothing is it void who laid the rules so we created gods but who created gods damn this is endless so i stopped thinking logically and think philosophy about it yes it is it stops right here the players are the gods of the universe the main equation of this game is assuming that mass is space space is mass and mass itself is also energy and needs to be filled at all the time so the universe will shrink and extend continuously with time from another point of view it is cooling down i think that the universe will be in a state of static finally the average space density will be very low and it will approach to 0 there are no dark matters or dark energy in it perhaps this is the way of gravity the concept is like this players play as the god of the universe and control molecules of the universe through gravity string this is a simulation of theoretical physics the phenomena in game are controlled by fundamental interaction there are weak  electromagnetic  strong and gravitation interactions there are gravitational strings between players and influence each others universe through quantum entanglement there is a server at present but the stability of the network still needs to be tested players release energy mass space in game every time a big bang occurs or civilizations evolved players will gain some power from it these powers are used to generate gravity and the amount of powers players used will be affecting the amount of the gravity in this virtual 2d universe we can create countless big bangs players can play offline or online whatever you like in the future players will be free to create the server of the universe and allow to modify the parameters like coefficients of interactions or color mask of course players can modify them right now but it`s a little difficult for most players,universe sandbox simulation game,indie simulation strategy early access,english

in out path is a puzzlesolving game where you control a cat on a journey to find redemption however various birds will block your progress along the way as animals can only travel along certain paths you need to use mechanisms that can change the positional relationships between animals to construct a safe path the game consists of 7 chapters each with different themed landscapes and music it offers over 20 different mechanisms and more than 300 levels join our discord game features our games core gameplay revolves around position swapping the first chapter introduces the basic game mechanics moving paths and red birds moving paths are mechanisms that cause a path to move when an animal touches them red birds act as enemies for the cat  if the cat touches a red bird it fails through the use of switches and moving paths players can change the positional relationship between the cat and the birds to create a safe path for the cat to pass through in subsequent levels after the first chapter the game presents various variations of moving paths including rotation stretching and multisegment path swapping however each variation is not too difficult and serves more as a showcase and guide the difficulty gradually increases in the last few levels of the first chapter the puzzle elements are clearly displayed on the map and there is no need to search for hidden items the focus is more on testing the players logical reasoning in applying the existing mechanisms in the second chapter the game introduces multiple new mechanisms while continuing the design style of the first chapter each mechanism is introduced in a few small levels to teach its basic usage and the real challenge comes in the later levels this design allows players to smoothly experience most of the content in each chapter while still providing a certain level of challenge it feels like slicing vegetables before facing the ultimate boss most puzzle games are confined to a 2d plane but our game incorporates 3d stereoscopic as an important part of puzzle design from the beginning the third chapter introduces a jumping mechanism the cat can perform longrange jumps using a swing it can jump over birds on flat ground and onto higher ground on maps with elevated terrain the maps of the first two chapters can be considered as a 2d plane but starting from the third chapter the game officially enters a threedimensional world new puzzlesolving methods like aerial collisions and switching between different levels of terrain liberate players from the constraints of a 2d world and truly immerse them in a threedimensional game we believe that breaking free from the limitations of the 2d plane can lead to the creation of better games the fourth chapter introduces a special bird  the purple bird the cat can exert a force on the purple bird to move it closer or farther away this mechanic is similar to pushing boxes but it is different from the traditional boxpushing mechanic the operation of exerting force remotely requires players to have control over the position between the cat and the purple bird combined with the threedimensional multilevel maps players have to consider more factors compared to simple 2d boxpushing starting from the fifth chapter the game introduces many elements that require operational skills such as snowballs and timers that require calculating time the wind blowing mechanism in the sixth chapter and the duplication mechanism in the seventh chapter also require a certain level of player skill however we have added teleportation houses as a mechanism with classic position swapping functionality to add flavor although these levels require operational skills we have tried to provide players with a certain margin of error as we want operation to be just a seasoning with logical reasoning being the main course of the game after completing the regular levels players face the challenge of the expansion levels in each chapter although the expansion levels are unlocked after completing the regular levels of each chapter they are significantly more difficult if the regular levels are like playing dynasty warriors then the expansion levels are like playing dark souls clearly the regular levels only act as appetizers while the expansion levels reveal the true nature of the game this is why the regular levels may give a feeling of showcasing and guiding the player however the expansion levels do not introduce new mechanisms or require the use of existing mechanisms in new ways to complete the levels the content of the game consists of various combinations of existing mechanisms from the regular levels its like a teacher teaching you mathematical formulas and now expecting you to use these formulas to solve various problems the characteristics of the game can be summarized as follows 1 the game progresses from a 2d plane to a 3d plane with operational elements gradually demanding more cognitive and operational skills from the players creating a basic difficulty curve 2 the regular levels ensure a rhythm of unlocking new mechanisms at regular intervals providing a continuous sense of freshness 3 the final few levels of the regular levels are relatively difficult ensuring a certain degree of challenge 4 most of the challenging levels are reserved for the expansion levels allowing most players to smoothly experience the game while retaining depth furthermore getting stuck is a normal situation in puzzle games to assist players who get stuck we have implemented a hint system in the game the hint system provides a simple gameplay recording for players to reference players can see the key points of completing the current level in the video recording we hope that players can comfortably enjoy the game without feeling frustrated by being stuck on a particular level with our sincere love for puzzle games we have created in out path hoping to convey our passion to every player and let more people experience the joy of puzzle games  ,you will play the role of a smart and agile kitten learn and utilize various strange and interesting mechanisms to unlock 300 puzzles that are extremely characteristic and full of challenges to obtain an unforgettable puzzlesolving experience,adventure casual indie strategy,english french german spanish  spain russian japanese simplified

hi im a solo game developer from são paulo brazil and this is my game trackmaster is a game about physics sandbox racing vehicular mess and crazy types of events and competitions doing unexpected things with unexpected vehicles want to take a trailer truck to a stunt track why not want to do a race in a figure 8 track featuring a monster truck a muscle car a truck and a bus why not the game will let you drive freely in any track in a freeroam mode race in tracks designed for collisions and take part in events for doing stunts dominating the hill playing football and many others trackmaster is really a project i have began because of those moments of if no one is making the game i want to play ill make it i want the physics and chaos of the old destruction derby games the freedom of old games like interstate76 and of modern games like beamngdrive the simplicity of super offroad and super skidmarks the crazy modes of test drive eve of destruction the mayhem of twisted metal the first one the monster trucks from monster truck madness all this with split screen multiplayer and more much more is that too much to ask the game is designed as a balanced blend of simulation and fun the vehicles are entirely governed by physics so that you can always see a different result from collisions jumps and stunts the vehicles sizes and weights are also proportional to each other as in real life if you drive a 6 ton truck at 100 kmh into regular cars expect the poor cars to get thown away but here comes the balance to be fun the truck wont take 15 seconds to reach 100 kmh as it would in real life its acceleration will let it race against sports cars and other fast vehicles the physics based system also allows for different handling of rwd rear wheel drive fwd front wheel drive and 4wd 4 wheel drive vehicles game modes freeroam  drive freely no time limits and no goals in any arena or track  available now event  races and other events see events below  available now career  start as a novice driver with a bad car and try to climb up the racing ranks  coming soon tournament  combinations of events in sequence  coming soon events 14 event types already in the game freestyle  do as many tricks as you can in 2 minutes front flips back flips spiral flips long and high jumps or prevent the others from doing their hard trained tricks racing  you know try to reach the finish line first in this game thats the only rule master of the hill  stay as long as you can on top of the hill for 2 minutes also make sure the other vehicles cant make it tag  or touch and go the playground game the one you played as a child now with big toys red rover  drive from one end of the arena to the other the last vehicle each time is out until there is only one the winner kamikaze race  a race event where half the vehicles drive the right way the other half the wrong way football  you know one ball two goals period coming soon there and back race  also race but you drive one lap the right way the next lap the wrong way and so on until finish around the flag race  and yet another race event after each lap make a circle around a flag in the middle of the track and then proceed to the next lap capture the flag  two teams each one with a flag take the other teams flag and bring to your base demolition  destroy anything that moves cops and robbers  or team tag  you also played this one as a child now with big toys too power potato  stay most of the time with the potato touch the vehicle with the potato to steal it hot potato  stay away from the potato the one carrying it loses points touch other vehicles to pass on the potato trailer mode  all of the above but with trailers attached try to finish the event with your trailers and try to make the other vehicles lose theirs the plan you can see how im planning to develop the game in the trackmaster website also i will present these updates here on steam so the plan end of 2022 the game at this point will feature all the vehicles 7 classes with a varying number of models inside each class to a total of 15 models 11 tracks plus the tracks variations and 14 game modes planned now 10 end of early access phase is planned to the end of 2023 the game at this point will feature online multiplayer lan multiplayer track editor and of course more vehicles tracks and game modes are going to be made nothing prevents some features to come out earlier than planned like online multiplayer i just cant promise it now after 10 free updates with more of everything described above and why not some new and cool things like an open world real world tracks steering wheel support vehicle destruction with soft body physics missions and scenarios but this are just dreams right now and i cant promise any of this so the idea is to build a racing game that is easy to play with a nice balance of fun and physics simulation so that there are always new stuff to do and try but that you can play in a relaxed way if you want as long as the game proves to be good and is financially viable i dont plan to abandon it after some features have being added it could go on for years why not i really like the way games like euroamerican truck simulator beamngdrive cities skylines and elite dangerous are made with great involvement from a community and constant and free updates and improvements i dont think im going for the paid dlc way even for the big content updates i like the idea of a game you can have at the beginning with just a few features but a solid foundation and years later you are still able to have fun with it but with much more content and more important with no more money for it so if you like the idea of a racing game to play the way you want with any vehicle that comes to your mind in crazy tracks with lots of chaos mayhem and solid physics i hope you can enjoy the game from now on,trackmaster is an allterrain allvehicles physics based sandbox and racing game play whatever way you want in any kind of track and event with any vehicle,action casual racing sports early access,english

players drop fruits one by one at any time and stack them up fruits roll based on physical calculations and when two fruits of the same type touch each other the fruit changes to a larger fruit based on the point of contact repeat this process to make the fruit bigger aiming to create the watermelon with the highest score players shoot fruit at a plate the fruit falls onto the plate following a ballistic trajectory on the plate collisions are calculated using 3d physics simulation fruits roll based on physical calculations and when two fruits of the same type touch each other the fruit changes to a larger fruit based on the point of contact repeat this process to make the fruit bigger aiming to create the watermelon with the highest score in detail introducing suika dish suika means watermelon suika dish is a fruitbased drop game players transform two fruits of the same kind into one larger fruit of another the goal is to make a watermelon in the end players compete for a score that is added each time a fruit is changed suika dish has three features first there is no time limit so you can play at your own pace the second feature is that the fruits are not dropped but instead are launched the fruit is launched and flies through the air on a ballistic trajectory and players can predict the movement of the fruit after it lands and rolls and think about where to aim finally the third feature is the ability to calm the fruit when it makes a crazy move suika dish does not have a time limit but it satisfies the players need to advance the game as quickly as possible suika dish allows for a rapidfire sequence of fruits to make the game go faster a large number of fruits can be dropped onto the plate in a short time the interval between consecutive shots is automatically adjusted according to the size of the fruits in front and behind the physical calculation of suika dish is performed in 3d as a result fruit movements are more complex and require more difficult predictions if a player is able to change fruits in the same turn that the fruit is thrown in it becomes a combo and a bonus is added to the score each successive combo increases the score bonus one of the interesting features of suika dish is the ability to calm down the movement of fruits as the game progresses the fruit may move unexpectedly in that case the player can stop the movement of the fruit by performing an action this is called calming it is not a socalled pause but it reduces the speed of the fruit to zero this is a movement that is not possible in reality this is a powerful fruit stop function but because of is powerful there are pitfalls to be aware of if the fruit is flying on a ballistic trajectory in the air at the exact moment when you use the fruit stop the fruit will plummet what if the fruit is still flying outside the dish the fruit will lose speed plummet and fall outside the plate ending the game keeping that in mind players can make the game progress more easily by occasionally calming the movement of the fruit suika dish is a new game that incorporates interesting and fun features in addition to simple rules i hope everyone enjoys this game thank you for your interest in suika dish estimated playtime 10 minutes60 minutes video distribution and live commentary limitation video distribution and live commentary using the gameplay is permitted under noncommercial and commercial situations through the internet video distribution service monetization is permitted only by the intrinsic monetization service of the video distribution service we expect you to add the game title and the steam store page url of this game to the video title or the video description we are not responsible for any damages caused by our products this note will be updated without notice,players drop fruits one by one at any time and stack them up and when two fruits of the same type touch each other the fruit changes to a larger fruit repeat this process to make the fruit bigger aiming to create the watermelon with the highest score,casual indie,english simplified chinese japanese french italian german spanish  spain indonesian spanish  latin america thai vietnamese portuguese  brazil portuguese  portugal arabic dutch turkish russian korean ukrainian greek swedish czech danish norwegian hungarian finnish bulgarian polish romanian traditional chinese icelandic azerbaijani georgian slovak swahili basque hindi filipino bangla mongolian luxembourgish irish afrikaans albanian welsh estonian kazakh galician croatian xhosa scots slovenian zulu serbian sotho bosnian maori macedonian malayalam maltese latvian lithuanian kinyarwanda

play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through the necropolis of the angels the hidden angel city the underworld and the third city of hell an exciting thirdperson shooter where the player will have to use intelligence as well as the trigger finger multiple different types of enemies male and female protagonists original punk ambient and classical soundtrack a story based on sumarian legends the book of enoch and other ancient writings his story has no beginning and no end in the past a race of angels on a distant world had reached the limit of their development they had exhausted the natural resources of their planet and had faced stagnation and decline with their eventual decline before them they built the ship known as the sky citadel a mobile space city in which they could travel across the sea of stars to find new worlds which they could exploit and dominate enslaving any existing populations they might find after travelling the vastness of space and time they came upon the earth a planet rich in the minerals they needed for their technology they found vast deposits of gold deep within the subterranean caverns a valuable resource which they hoped would be a catalyst for a renaissance of their disintegrating culture upon the earth they discovered many lifeforms all of which were far more primitive than themselves lifeforms which they could using their science and magic change and modify to create slaves and playthings for their pleasure and use they took their angel essence and mixed it with the beasts of the grasslands to create docile and willing comfort males and females to satiate their lust they mixed their essence with the apes to create the slaves to mine minerals they desired they used their essence with the fishes of the oceans to create the builders of the great undersea city they created a myriad of giants dwarfs fabulous beautiful creatures monsters and abominations these creations were later to be known as the fae in time when the angels had taken vast amounts of gold from the earth they left to continue their odyssey of conquest and exploitation leaving 199 angels on earth to oversee the planet’s domination in time the angel overseers came to feel love for their subjects and began to breed with them and eventually school them in the arts of warfare science architecture medicine and aesthetics within time the overseers freed their slaves and adopted an egalitarian societal model eventually the former slaves and their former overseers built vast cities together creating a paradise upon the earth eventually the sky citadel returned after a long and unsuccessful voyage at this stage most of the technology of the sky citadel no longer functioned and all the knowledge of the home planet was now lost in the mists of time the angels had decided that they would now have to establish a new home upon the earth however the inhabitants of the returning sky citadel were horrified to find that the 199 overseers had created a new society and had genetically intermixed themselves with the slave races the action the angels took was swift and brutal led by the first clone of the master the angel champion the angels attacked the fabulous city of atlantis capturing most of the overseers crippling their wings torturing them and eventually imprisoning them in the caverns of subterrania they then moved the sky citadel closer to the earth causing fluctuations in the weather the result of which was a global flood that wiped out the civilisation of the overseers very few of the fae survived and those that did were forced to live hidden away and in secret the angels reestablished the old order using a newly created slave race part angel part ape to develop the science and technologies the angels needed to repair and develop the sky citadel which by this time was little more than a floating hulk with most of the technology no longer functioning the original science technology and knowledge which had been behind the building of the sky citadel were by this time long forgotten and lost to time the angels were now relying on their slaves to eventually develop an advanced civilisation which the angels would then take control of in the meantime deep in the caverns of the earth the former overseers and now rebel angels along with a few of the fae which had survived the flood had overthrown the guard race keeping them prisoner all of the guards had renounced their allegiance to the angels and had joined the rebels the rebel angels had then begun building a huge city so that they and their allies could live in comfort and safety as the rebels had been the scientists alchemists and thinkers of the original angel society they were able to utilise what resources they had at hand there were many new discoveries one of these being brimstone fire the sulphuric blue energy with which they could power and light their great city and another being vril the energy source which when combined with brimstone fire and focused through different mineral lenses could produce a super energy with the discovery of vril work began on the brimstone ray a canon so powerful it would be capable of neutralising all of the advanced technology on the sky citadel there was however a problem for the rebel angels the four gems which were to form the lenses needed for the vril accumulators the essential energy focusing component of the brimstone ray were located in the rebellion friendly city of sodom on the surface above city which was under attack by the angel army the angels had sent agents into sodom who had learned of the existence of the gems but not the location they had then used ‘rain of fire’ a primitive but effective technology where sulphur pellets were shot at a target from the sky citadel to destroy the city then as sodom burned and it’s citizens were reduced to panic and madness the angel soldiers moved in searching for the gems it is at this point a rebel angel foot soldier and a dark angel resurrectionist managed to defeat hundreds of angels and locate the gems before the angels did they then escaped the falling city of sodom travelled beneath the dead sea across the bridge of the damned and entered the newly built third city of hell where they took the gems to the vril accumulators then they made their way to the mountains at the top of the world and fired the brimstone ray the sky citadel was completely incapacitated by the blast leaving it a cratered rock floating in the earth’s sky following this victory the rebels began planning their final assault however the angel empire was far from finished in a secret location they had built a fabulous city where they had managed to relocate some of their advanced weaponry including a timetravelling device called ‘the bell’ ‘the bell’ had enabled the angels to make contact with developing civilizations in the earth’s future and exchange ideas weaponry and armour in addition to their hidden city the angels had also began creating a subterranean network of outposts and tunnels this network had enabled them to wage war on the rebel cities of hell in time with the aid of reconverted rebels the angels managed a major raid on the third city of hell stealing away all of the bloodfire and brimstone weapons they also managed to take with them the recently developed angelfire weapons the queen of the city is now in hiding awaiting assistance this raid gave the angels a distinct technological over the rebels who now face total extermination a team of elite dark angel soldiers have already attempted to locate and destroy ‘the bell’ in the hope of stopping the angels from gaining further technology from future civilizations the y managed to find the location of the hidden city which they have reported back is a a cemetery which archives the ashes of all the dead angels in the hope of resurrecting them sometime in the days yet to come the advance team also reported that although the angels have brimstone and bloodfire weapons they have yet to utilise them to their full potential also the angels now have in addition to archangels in their ranks several valkyries who are stronger and able to fly somewhat despite the earth’s strong gravity and the weight of their armour the advance team also managed to report that they had located ‘the bell’ and were about to attempt to destroy it however they were captured and now face torture and death in the angel’s prison the survival of the rebel angels now hangs in the balance the queen of the third city of hell needs to be saved and the angel occupation force defeated then the advance team needs to be rescued from the prison so that they can report the location of the angel city and the bell then the bell must be destroyed at all costs,play as a fallen angel fighting a host of enemies through the necropolis of the angels the hidden angel city the underworld and the third city of hell an exciting thirdperson shooter where the

spritify is a tool for the fast and easy generation of 2d sprites it transforms simple input images consisting of smart pixels into many distinct output images with varying properties such as gradient noise and color which can then be exported and used in your projects demo version theres a demo version of spritify that you can get for free to evaluate it in the demo some of the import and export functions are disabled also many of the sizes and factors are greatly limited palette canvas sprite counts scaling factors  all other features are available guide quick overview hotkeys note that several functions can also be performed via hotkeys hover your cursor over functions to see if theres a hotkey mapped to it canvas on the canvas you can draw your input image which is then used to generate your sprites the canvas displays both the color and behavior of individual pixels the color is displayed as a pixels color the behavior as a character more under brushes  you can left click to draw single pixels drag while holding the left mouse button to draw a path or right click to flood fill by default the canvas is filled with the background color and n one behavior when hovering with your cursor the currently active brush will be displayed the canvas after drawing several pixels the preview below the canvas theres a preview of the sprite it will display the same result youd receive by performing an export please note that the previews pixels are scaled to always use all available space your exported result will likely have smaller pixels sidebar the sidebar contains all of spritifys settings and controls the sidebar is split in groups which can be expanded and collapsed by clicking a groups header import  export here you can save and load projects and export your sprites load import a previously saved spritify project you can also import projects by opening the files with spritify or using dragampdrop save save your current project resultzip export your sprite as zip archive containing the individual bmp images resultbmp export your sprite as a single bmp image what you see in the preview brushes your current brush and pixels on the canvas consist of a color and behavior  the different brushes are described below color brushes the color brushes set the color a pixel will have the currently active brush is highlighted with gt youll notice that each name here has its distinct color these colors are also placed on the canvas when drawing with that brush background drawing pixels with the background color similar to erasing pixels you can set the background color in the colors controls fixed drawing pixels with the fixed color pixels using this color will always have the same color you can define which color to use in colors dynamic drawing pixels with the dynamic color pixels using this color will vary in color they might each end up with a different color noise and shading in your final sprite many settings affect how these pixels behave see more under flags  shading  noise and palette dynamic  background pixels will randomly either become a dynamic or background pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  background pixels will randomly either become a fixed or background pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  dynamic pixels will randomly either become a fixed or dynamic pixel with a 5050 chance fixed  dynamic  background pixels will randomly either become a fixed  dynamic or background pixel with a 333333 chance behavior brushes the behavior brushes define the behavior of a pixel during the generation process the currently active brush is highlighted with gt youll notice that the first character of each brush is highlighted thats the character that is being placed onto the canvas if you use this brush none this is basically the background or off of the behaviors pixels of this type are considered to not exist at all during the simulation static this is basically the on of the behaviors pixels of this type are always active and considered to be present during the simulation if pixels of this type are considered to be static if they have a neighbor otherwise they are considered to the none  with these pixels you can define areas that all turn on or off together walker these pixels will leave a trail on the canvas by following a random path theyll stop randomly or if they hit something they behave similar to the snake game filler pixels of this type will fill their surrounding area to a random degree they are similar to the walker pixels but instead of creating a trail they create more radial shapes like drops of ink jiggler jigglers will move randomly to a neighbor position or remain where they are any chooses any of the other behaviors randomly in this example you can see two groups of if pixels and a group of filler pixels in the result youll notice that the if groups are either present entirely or not at all whenever one of the filler pixels reached one of the groups the entire group got activated one of the if pixels activates due to having a neighbor which then can activate another if pixel until the entire group is active controls here you can find various functions to edit the canvas arrow left undo the last canvas action drawing resizing arrow right redo the last canvas action drawing resizing  zoom in displaying the canvas with larger pixels  zoom out displaying the canvas with smaller pixels  increase the size of the canvas by adding a row or column depending on the location of the button  decrease the size of the canvas by removing a row or column depending on the location of the button 7x6 the current size is displayed at the center cleari clear the canvas resetting all invisible pixels outside of current drawing area cleara clear the canvas resetting all pixels flags in this group you can find multiple flags to control the sprite generation mirror right mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas to the right mirror down mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas downwards edge if the right or bottom edge should also be mirrored outline outline the final result with fixed pixels remove lonely remove pixels without any neighbours mirroring below some examples explaining the mirroring flags all mirroring is disabled and theres 4 pixels drawn to the bottom right of the canvas mirroring to the right is enabled the edge is not mirrored in addition to the 4 pixels we now see two of them being mirrored now both mirroring to the right and edge mirroring is enabled theres now 8 pixels visible since all 4 input pixels were mirrored additionally downwards mirroring is now enabled no edge outline when this is active the fixed color is used to outline the generated images this usually only makes sense when also setting the scaling to gt 1 since otherwise most pixels will be overwritten here the outline setting is disabled here the outline setting is enabled remove lonely removal of lonely pixels disabled theres pixels without any neighbours in the output removal of lonely pixels enabled theres no pixels without any neighbours in the output sprite counts here you can set the number of images your sprite will have count in x number of images per row count in y number of image rows shading in this group you can configure the shading enable shading here you can toggle the shading brightness sets the brightness of the shading specific direction enable this if you want to set a specific shading direction for all your sprite images otherwise a random direction is chosen per image direction sets the shading direction if specific direction is enabled below some example shading configurations here shading is disabled theres no brightness gradient within the images shading is enabled the brightness is set to high in this image shading is enabled the brightness set to low here the shading direction is set to down noise strength sets the strength of the noise how noisy the sprite will be a low noise value a high value is set for the noise scaling you can scale your output image creating several output pixels per input pixel be careful when combining this with high sprite counts since the sprite generation can then use a lot of memory and time also avoid setting high values for both scaling factors since their multiplication affects the performance both set to 10 gt 100x worse factor before this factor is applied before the simulation having an impact on it more pixels with different values this has a huge impact on the performance factor after this factor is applied at the end only affecting the size of the output pixels duplicated with their values this has less impact on the performance but still must be used with caution a scaling before factor of one every input pixel creates an output pixel a scaling before factor of two every input pixel creates 2x2 4 output pixels scaled with a factor before of 16 creating 16x16 256 output pixels per input pixel colors fixed the color of fixed pixels background the color of the background the default color configuration of black fixed pixels and a white background using different colors palette here you can choose an image that will be used as source for dynamic pixel colors if you dont choose an image random colors are used otherwise your images pixels are used as input reset unset the image and use random colors instead load load an image as color source an image of a fire being used as palette an image of the sky used as palette seed here you can define a seed used for the random generation changing this seed has a huge impact on the generated outcome edit text you can use the text field to set a specific seed roll click to use a randomly chosen seed result with a specific seed using another seed but the same configuration and
